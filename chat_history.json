We receive a notification via text that includes the customer's name, phone number, email, vehicle details (VIN, year, make/model, and mileage), and a checkbox for customer consent to be contacted.  We also need the marketings rep first name and last name to see how many leads (business they are bringing in to Quotiiva. i also need the app to have the ability to downloan pictures. We provide quotes to the customers from top-rated insurance carriers and streamline the process of purchasing an insurance policy. \r\n\r\nIn return for each lead they send to Quotiiva, the dealership's sales professionals receive a referral fee of $25.00. However, the biggest challenge we face is tracking these $25.00 payments. We need an app that can track this information by sales professional. The app should allow sales professionals to enroll and monitor the number of leads they submit on a weekly and monthly basis. Additionally, it should enable them to see how much money is owed to them.\r\n\r\nFor branding our company colors are Orange and Blue this our company logo:\r\n\r\n"}, {"type": "image", "image": {"filename": "D255713D-E7D3-413F-9A74-01248C1A6355 (3).PNG", "unique_filename": "5ce32514-d158-4969-9630-4a88a47dbf9e.png", "content_type": "image/png", "file_url": "https://prod-finalquest-user-projects-storage-bucket-aws.s3.amazonaws.com/user-projects/07b1d006-7292-4062-929a-6893b4f93a99/assets/images/5ce32514-d158-4969-9630-4a88a47dbf9e.png?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAVRUVRKQJC5DISQ4Q&Signature=TlLAq9m97sePn%2BKE6CJXtaUpOC8%3D&Expires=1759150592"}}]}, {"role": "assistant", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Okay, I understand.
